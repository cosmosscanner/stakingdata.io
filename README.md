**This is a Ping.pub fork by DECALI.io - the repo do not have wallet connections and therefore a good option for the US based validators.**

`Stakingdata.io Dashboard` is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains - a forked version of the popular Ping.pub app - https://ping.pub.

## What is the difference between Stakingdata.io explorer and other explorers? 

`Dashboard` is designed by Ping.pub, to explore blockchain data as real as possible, therefore there is no cache, no pre-processing. `Stakingdata.io Dashboard` only fetch data from Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints. Ping.pub calls it a "Light Explorer".

## Do you want to list your blockchain on ping.pub?

Submit your pull request [here](./src/chains). Ping.pub will add your chains as soon as possible. It is **FREE** (You must have 10+ independent validators on your chain).

Ping.pub states that they remain neutral to all chains, and we do not comment on their market prospects, technical risks, or investment risks. The only condition we list on ping.pub is if there are ten validators, and we cannot determine if these validators are controlled by the same entity.

## Why Stakingdata/Ping explorer use official/trusted third party public LCD/rpc server? 

There are two main reasons:

   - Trust, in a decentralized system, anything controlled by one entity cannot be trusted. So we decided to build with the community.
   - Limited resources: `Ping Dashboard` will list hundreds of cosmos-based blockchains in the future, and it is impossible for our team to run validators or full nodes for all of them.
